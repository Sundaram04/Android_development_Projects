1 -> Birthday_wishing_app :- In this app, I learned how to use 
                            
                        a -> Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
                        b -> The user interface (UI) of an app is what you see on the screen: text, images, buttons, and many other types of elements.
                        c -> Composable functions are the basic building block of Compose. A composable function is a function that describes some part of your UI.
                        d -> The Composable function is annotated with the @Composable annotation; this annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI.
                        e -> The three basic standard layout elements in Compose are Column, Row, and Box. They are Composable functions that take Composable content, so you can place items inside. For example, each child within a Row will be placed horizontally next to each other.
                        f -> The Resource Manager tab in Android Studio helps you add and organize your images and other resources.
                        g -> An Image composable is a UI element that displays images in your app.
                        h -> An Image composable should have a content description to make your app more accessible.

2 -> Compose_article :- Here, I learned about the

                            a -> TextAlign.Justify Property

                            b -> Center align all of the content vertically and horizontally on the screen.

4 -> Compose_Quadrant :- In this app, I learned about some more ui specifications
                            a -> Divide the entire screen into four equal parts, each of which contains a Compose card and displays information about a Composable function
                            b -> Center align all of the content vertically and horizontally in each quadrant.
                            c -> Weight modifier function , FontWeight.Bold property

5 -> Dice_Roller :- On developing this app, I learned how to 
                            a -> Create layouts with Compositions.
                            b -> Create a button with the Button composable.
