Android Development Projects

1 -> Birthday_wishing_app :- In this app, I learned how to use 
                            
                        a -> Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
                        b -> The user interface (UI) of an app is what you see on the screen: text, images, buttons, and many other types of elements.
                        c -> Composable functions are the basic building block of Compose. A composable function is a function that describes some part of your UI.
                        d -> The Composable function is annotated with the @Composable annotation; this annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI.
                        e -> The three basic standard layout elements in Compose are Column, Row, and Box. They are Composable functions that take Composable content, so you can place items inside. For example, each child within a Row will be placed horizontally next to each other.
                        f -> The Resource Manager tab in Android Studio helps you add and organize your images and other resources.
                        g -> An Image composable is a UI element that displays images in your app.
                        h -> An Image composable should have a content description to make your app more accessible.

2 -> Compose_article :- Here, I learned about the

                            a -> TextAlign.Justify Property
                            b -> All types of padding 
                            c -> How to write text below the images 

3 -> Task_Manager :- Here, I learned about the 
                            
                            a -> UI specification
                            b -> Center align all of the content vertically and horizontally on the screen.

4 -> Compose_Quadrant :- In this app, I learned about some more ui specifications

                            a -> Divide the entire screen into four equal parts, each of which contains a Compose card and displays information about a Composable function
                            b -> Center align all of the content vertically and horizontally in each quadrant.
                            c -> Weight modifier function , FontWeight.Bold property

5 -> Dice_Roller :- On developing this app, I learned how to 

                            a -> Create layouts with Compositions.
                            b -> Create a button with the Button composable.
                            c -> Import drawable resources.
                            d -> Display an image with the Image composable.
                            e -> Use the remember composable to store objects in a Composition to memory.
                            f -> Refresh the UI with the mutableStateOf()function to make an observable.

6 -> Lemonade :- Here, I learned about the 

                            a -> clickable modifier to go to the next screen
                            b -> remember composables

7 -> Affirmations :- Here, I learned about the 

                            a -> Use Card composables to create list items.
                            b -> Modify the UI contained within a Card composable.
                            c -> Create a scrollable list using the LazyColumn composable.
                            d -> Place app icon files in the mipmap resource directories.
                            e -> Provide different versions of an app icon bitmap image in each density bucket (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) for backwards compatibility with older versions of Android.
                            f -> Add resource qualifiers onto resource directories to specify resources that should be used on devices with a certain configuration (v24 or v26).
                            g -> Vector drawables are Android's implementation of vector graphics. They are defined in XML as a set of points, lines, and curves, along with associated color information. Vector drawables can be scaled for any density without loss of quality.
                            h -> Adaptive icons were introduced to the Android platform in API 26. They are made up of a foreground and background layer that follow specific requirements, so that your app icon looks high-quality on a range of devices with different OEM masks.
                            i -> Use Image Asset Studio in Android Studio to create legacy and adaptive icons for your app.
